                        The other day,
                        <a href="https://alexgolec.dev/reddit-interview-problems-the-game-of-life/" target="_blank">this article</a>
                        came across my feed which made me curious about
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a>.
                        As per Wikipedia:
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton
                        devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.
                        It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by
                        its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the
                        Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how
                        it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal
                        constructor or any other Turing machine.

                    <p>
                        The rules for <strong>Life</strong> are shown in the chart below.
                        A <strong>neighbor</strong> is any adjacent item, including diagonals.

                        There are many solutions around for this problem; they often
                        use multi-dimensional arrays and nested loops.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I fell the down the rabbit-hole of trying to solve it for a
                        flat array using maps. There was no particular reason for this
                        other than the fact I wanted to. This solution is less about solving
                        the problem the best way as opposed to solving it the way I wanted
                        to solve it; for fun.

                        Changing the size of the board will generate a new random
                        set of data. Increase iterations and pay attention to the
                        changing numbers which represent <strong>neighbor count</strong>
                        and how they follow the rules above.
